Open world game designer inside of Blender.

The target game engine is undecided (Unity? Unreal? Godot?).
The world is saved as sectors of a sphere, one .blend file 
per sector.  The plan is to write a custom sector format that
will preprocess that data, to e.g. split UV islands, compile
shaders, etc.
